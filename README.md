A fully functional role playing game engine.  All it requires is data files created using the tools listed in requirements.txt

Current progress only allows for text-based games but will eventually be updated to also allow for GUI.  I fully intend to keep text-based capability for those who would rather use it.

Current goal
-Update tests
